This repo shows how to build this simple element using pure JS, ```React.createElement()``` and React JSX. It will demonstrates how React abstracts the DOM manipulation. 

Just uncomment and comment the parts then reload the HTML to see them in action.

Other details are included in the comments.

Happy hacking !
